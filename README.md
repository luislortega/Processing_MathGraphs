# Processing_MathGraphs

**Deadline:** 
- May 20, 2019

**Team:**
- Luis Leon
- Noe Bautista
- Fernanda Madera

**To do before evaluation:**
- [x] Show multiple points with mouse clicking.
- [ ] Show lines
- [ ] Conect vertex and edges
- [ ] Make the algorithm to show a Graph with a simple array of information
- [ ] Make the graph dynamic

**Evaluation:**
1) Investigation of real life problems that can be represent with a Graph. 
Explain the representations and 多What represent a vertex? 多What represent an edge? and graph type

- [ ] Use Processing 3.0
- [ ] Show the graph available to add and delete edges
- [ ] The graph need be represent by a matrix with a commentary "Matriz que representa al grafo"
- [ ] The program should include the implementation of the algorithms related to the following topics: graph isomorphism, find routes and circuits, shortest route, evaluate graphs planes, graph coloring problem

2) Investigation of real life problems that can be represent with a Node Three.
Explain the representations and 多What represent a vertex? 多What represent an edge? and Node Three type

- [ ] Use Processing 3.0
- [ ] The program should allow to print a list with the nodes in pre order, in order and post order.
- [ ] The program must keep an account of the total number of nodes, leaves and height of the tree.
- [ ]The program must allow the location of an X node through a search strategy and
print the path from the root to the node.

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] A report describing the problem and how the graphs or trees were used to give a solution. It must be explained what algorithms were chosen and programmed according to the Real life problem.
- [ ] A table with the name of each participant and the tasks performed in the project.
- [ ] The source code of the graph example and the tree one.
- [ ] A link to a video on the internet where the team presents its project and it is clearly seen the execution of its programs with all the requested characteristics
